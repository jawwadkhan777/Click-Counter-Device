# Console-Based Click Counter Device in Java

This repository contains a simple **Console-Based Click Counter Device** develop in **Java**. The project is built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **Inheritance**, **Encapsulation**, and **Abstraction**. The project is implemented in **IntelliJ IDEA** as part of my learning journey.

## Project Overview ðŸ”¢

The **Click Counter Device** simulates a basic counter mechanism where the user can:
- **Increment** the counter by pressing a key.
- **Reset** the counter to zero.
- **Exit** the program gracefully by following a specific input.

## Instructions ðŸ“‹

The program operates as a **Clicker-Counter** device with simple keyboard controls. Below are the usage instructions:

1. Press **1** to increment the counter.
2. Press **0** to reset the counter to **0**.
3. Press **-1** to exit the counter program.
4. After each operation, press **Enter** to submit the action and continue.
